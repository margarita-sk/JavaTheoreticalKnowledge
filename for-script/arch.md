  <summary>What is DDD?</summary>
Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach aimed at managing complex software projects by emphasizing the importance of deeply understanding the domain 
  (the business area or problem space) in which the software will be used. This methodology helps create a shared understanding among all stakeholders, 
  ensuring that the software accurately reflects the real-world processes and needs it is designed to address. The key concepts of DDD include:

Domain-Driven Design is particularly useful for complex domains where a deep understanding of business logic is crucial, and it thrives in environments where continuous collaboration and communication are possible.

Benefits of DDD
- Business Alignment: Ensures the software matches the actual business needs.
- Clear Communication: Promotes better understanding among team members.
- Adaptability: Makes it easier to update the software when business processes change.
  
Challenges of DDD
- Learning Curve: Requires time to understand and implement.
- Complexity: Can add complexity, especially in large projects.
- Initial Effort: Needs significant initial effort to establish a solid domain model and common language.

  <summary>What the DDD app consists of?</summary>
  Domain-driven design also defines several high-level concepts that can be used in conjunction with one another to create and modify domain models:

- **Entity**: DO that has an ID and is mutable
- **Value Object**: DO that has no id and is immutable)
- **Aggregate**: A cluster of entities and value objects with defined boundaries around the group.
- **Domain Event**: An object that records a discrete event related to model activity within the system. While *all* events within the system could be tracked, a domain event is only created for event types that the domain experts care about.
- **Domain Services** : Encapsulates *business logic* that doesn't naturally fit within a domain object, and are **NOT** typical CRUD operations â€“ those would belong to a *Repository*.
- **Application Services** : Used by external consumers to talk to your system (think *Web Services*). If consumers need access to CRUD operations, they would be exposed here.
- **Infrastructure Services** : Used to abstract technical concerns (e.g. MSMQ, email provider, etc).
- **Repositories**: Not to be confused with common version control repositories, the DDD meaning of a repository is a service that uses a global interface to provide access to all entities and value objects within a particular aggregate collection. Methods should be defined to allow for the creation, modification, and deletion of objects within the aggregate. However, by using this repository service to make data queries, the goal is to remove such data query capabilities from within the business logic of object models

  <summary>What is the difference between domain service and application service?</summary>

  While both Application services and Domain services implement the business rules, there are fundamental logical and formal differences;
- Application Services implement the **use cases** of the application (user interactions in a typical web application), while Domain Services implement the **core, use case-independent domain logic**.
- Application Services get/return Data Transfer Objects, Domain Service methods typically get and return the **domain objects** (entities, value objects).
- Domain services are typically used by the Application Services or other Domain Services, while Application Services are used by the Presentation Layer or Client Applications.

  <summary>What is Event Driven Design?</summary>

Event-Driven Design (EDD) is an architectural pattern and methodology used in software development, where the flow of the application is determined 
by events that occur rather than by a sequential flow of control.

Benefits of Event-Driven Design:
- Scalability: Supports scalable and responsive systems by handling events asynchronously.
- Modularity: Promotes modular and loosely coupled architectures, making it easier to add or modify functionalities.
Challenges of Event-Driven Design:
- Complexity: Managing event flows and ensuring proper sequencing of event handlers can be complex.
- Eventual Consistency: Ensuring consistency across distributed systems when events are processed asynchronously.
- Debugging: Debugging and tracing event flows can be challenging compared to traditional sequential programming.

  <summary>What are the key aspects of Event-Driven Design?</summary>

- Events: Events are occurrences or happenings within the system or from external sources that are of interest to the application. These can include user actions (like clicking a button), system notifications (like a file being updated), or messages from other services.
- Event Handlers: Event-Driven Design relies on event handlers, which are functions or methods that are executed in response to specific events. When an event occurs, the corresponding event handler is triggered to perform some action or process related to that event.
- Asynchronous Processing: Events are typically processed asynchronously, meaning the application can continue to handle other tasks while waiting for events to occur. This asynchronous nature can improve responsiveness and scalability.
- Loose Coupling: Event-Driven Design promotes loose coupling between components. Components or services that generate events do not need to know anything about the components that handle those events, promoting modularity and flexibility in the system architecture.
- Publish-Subscribe Model: Often, Event-Driven Design utilizes a publish-subscribe (pub-sub) model, where components (publishers) emit events without knowledge of which components (subscribers) will handle them. Subscribers can register interest in specific types of events and receive notifications when those events occur.
